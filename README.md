# hello-world

Hi GitHubians!
I am a so-called (back in the 90s) "noob" in code and expect to remain so for the rest of my life despite continuous efforts to improve my coding self.
Would be happy to discuss with anybody who has anything to say, but mostly with people who don't have anything to say as discussion is generally much more interesting!
Let's keep in touch and change the world ;)
